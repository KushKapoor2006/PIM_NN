# PIM-NN Evaluation Report

**Project:** PIM-NN (Processing-In-Memory Neural Network Accelerator)
**Focus:** Comparative evaluation of *Micromanagement* vs *Hardware Sequencer* control schemes.

## 1. Purpose

This evaluation report consolidates all relevant simulation and hardware parameters, baseline and enhanced performance metrics, underlying assumptions, and modeling choices used in the PIM-NN project.

The objective is to demonstrate how a hardware sequencer integrated within a PIM accelerator yields measurable improvements in performance and control efficiency compared to CPU-driven micromanagement. The analysis is supported by RTL and calibrated Python simulations.

| **Metric**                             | **Micromanagement (Baseline)** | **Sequencer (Enhanced)** | **Improvement**                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| CPU Commands per Layer                 | 4 × Layers                     | 1 × Layers               | 4× fewer                                      |
| CPU Issue Time                         | High (`434 × cmds`)            | Minimal (1 × EXECUTE)    | Reduced ≈400×                                 |

## 4. Calibrated Speedup Scenarios

### 4.1 3.02× Case (RTL-correlated)

| **Parameter**        | **Value** |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| MACS_PER_CYCLE       | 8         |
| FIFO_DEPTH           | 4         |
| Layers               | 3         |
| CPU_ISSUE_CYCLES_MIC | 434       |
| CPU_ISSUE_CYCLES_SEQ | 1         |
| Resulting Speedup    | **3.02×** |

This calibration mimics the SystemVerilog TB environment, where the micromanagement CPU issues every opcode synchronously while the sequencer autonomously steps through preloaded microprograms.

### 4.2 Sweep Summary (20-layer network)

| MACS_PER_CYCLE | FIFO_DEPTH | Speedup | Interpretation                                |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1              | 1–8        | 1.00×   | Control latency dominates, but still balanced |
| 8              | 1–8        | 1.01×   | Compute-heavy, small marginal benefit         |
| 32             | 1–8        | 1.00×   | Fully compute-dominated; CPU cost negligible  |

This demonstrates that sequencer benefits are workload- and control-intensity-dependent.

## 5. Assumptions & Simplifications

1. **Single shared bus** — serialized access across CPU and PIM; contention modeled deterministically.
2. **Cycle-based model** — coarse-grained timing (no pipeline overlap, hazards ignored).
3. **Fixed IO latencies** — IO operations take constant 150 cycles.
4. **Idealized compute model** — compute time scales directly with MACS_PER_CYCLE.
5. **Energy model** — linearized (not transistor-level accurate) with constant per-event energy.
6. **Sequencer modeled as single FSM** — no hierarchical microsequencing or interleaved layers.
7. **Clock domain** — single domain (100 MHz equivalent) used in both RTL and Python.
8. **No memory stalls** — bus is blocking but deterministic; no DRAM queueing modeled.
9. **CPU delay purely synthetic** — `CPU_ISSUE_CYCLES_MIC` calibrated for relative behavior, not real MHz mapping.

---

## 6. Real-World Interpretation

* **When Sequencer Helps:**

  * Small, latency-sensitive kernels (e.g., control-heavy CNN blocks, dynamic layers).
  * Systems where CPU intervention latency dominates over compute time.

* **When Speedup Collapses:**

  * Large, compute-bound workloads (deep CNN layers, dense MLPs).
  * PIM throughput saturates; CPU overhead becomes negligible.

* **Energy Insight:**

  * Sequencer reduces dynamic CPU control energy and eliminates repeated handshakes.
  * Bus energy and MAC energy remain similar — major gain comes from command consolidation.

---

## 7. Validation and Correlation

* **RTL Validation:** The SystemVerilog testbench (`tb_sequencer_accelerator.sv`) prints total times for both modes and an end-of-run `Speedup: 3.02x`, matching the Python-calibrated run.
* **Python Reproduction:** `simulation/main_sim.py` outputs a `speedup.png` figure with a red star marker labelled “3.02x (Calibrated @ FIFO=4)”.
* **Trace Consistency:** The CSV traces show correct sequencing and reduced command count for sequencer mode.

| Compute utilization      | 0.72            | 0.91      | +26%        |

## 10. Conclusion

The PIM-NN project successfully demonstrates — both in RTL and calibrated Python simulation — that incorporating a **hardware sequencer** can yield **≈3× performance speedup** and reduced CPU control overhead for control-heavy, latency-sensitive PIM workloads. While the benefit reduces for large compute-bound networks, the architectural principle remains clear: decoupling CPU command issuance from low-level micro-op management significantly enhances efficiency.

Future extensions can integrate deeper pipeline models, realistic DRAM backpressure, or hybrid sequencer hierarchies to further quantify design trade-offs.
